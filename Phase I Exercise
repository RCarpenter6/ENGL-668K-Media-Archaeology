There are six antique computers set up for you to experiment with at MITH. In this, Phase I of the Media Archaeology module, you will learn basic facts about the pedigree of each, figure out how to turn it on (not always obvious!), and perform a few simple tasks to get a feel for how it works. You will work individually for this first phase of the module, logging your activity with each machine via GitHub. (Feel free to ask a classmate for help if you’re genuinely stuck on something, but only after you’ve made an honest effort on your own.) 

For the second phase of the module (to be distributed) you will work in pairs or small groups, choosing one or two computers for a more detailed exploration which may involve building or making something with its original software, and/or doing deeper historical and analytical work. 

You will generally have access to the computers any time MITH is open to the public, which is Mon-Fri, 9-5. Feel free to contact me with any logistical or technical problems. Phase I of this module is due by October 27.

*** Safe Handling ***

Some of these computers are more than three and a half decades old! They built ‘em strong back then so you don’t have to handle them with kid gloves, but please do treat the hardware with respect. To that end:

•	Absolutely no food or drink on the tabletop.
•	Some of the plugs and connections holding everything together are loose or delicate. If a machine doesn’t turn on check that all of its components are snugly plugged and connected, and that there is power going to it. Use common sense to try troubleshooting.
•	Never force anything. If something doesn’t seem to want to work or go or bend or fit, leave it be and ask me.
•	Please keep fingers off of the recording surface of the diskettes. Also keep magnets away!
•	All of the computers except the two Macs can simply be switched off at any point (though you will lose your work unless it’s been saved to a disk). The Macs should always be shut down using the appropriate option under the “Special” heading of the home menu (top of screen).
•	When you turn a computer off, wait about 10 seconds before turning it back on.
•	Please neaten up the workspace around each computer when you finish. Return diskettes to sleeves and holders, stack any books in an orderly fashion, etc.
•	Above all: please remember to turn these computers OFF when you are done with them. Remember, the learning experience for everyone starts with figuring out how to turn them on! Moreover, they won’t go to “sleep” on their own, and whatever is left of their lifespan will be diminished if they are left running.

*** The Exercise ***

For each computer, answer the questions and perform the tasks indicated. Feel free to consult any reference sources you spot around MITH (check the spline!), and/or Wikipedia or other online sources.

Make some additional notes below about each machine as you go: What’s the most notable difference from a computer that you’re used to? Can this computer and its software do anything that your current computer cannot?

KAYPRO 4

•	What year was it made? 
  1984
•	What operating system does it run? 
  CP/M 2.2 (Control Program for Microcomputers) 
•	How much did it cost (then and now, adjusted for inflation)? How hard is it to find one on the secondhand market (check eBay and Craig’s List). 
  $1,800 then would cost about $4,122.24 now. I was able to find a couple Kaypro 4s for sale on ebay and other sites (varagesale.com) but the Kaypro 2
  had many more postings, especially on ebay. 
•	In brief (a short paragraph), what were its historical strengths and weaknesses as a platform? What was it best known for?
  ***************************
Turn it on (you must figure out how). Start WordStar (you must figure out how). Try typing a simple document, experimenting with some commands based on the keyboard template. (You don’t need to save your document.)
  The most notable difference is working form the command line to open programs as opposed to a desktop screen. Also, the positioning of the arrow
  keys in a linear as opposed to a compass form was a different design that forced me to acually think about the buttons I was pushing. I also like 
  that the model is technically portable, although I can't imagine hefting it around on the bus and to class everyday so I wonder what/who its mobility
  was for. Many of the command prompts, or I guess keyboard shorcuts, do not work on my computer now. While the presence of a mouse makes naviagation easier
  I think it would still be useful to have universal keyboard prompts for things like spelling. Although, part of the reason that doesn't exist is probably because
  users work across so many programs and platforms that a universal prompt might be difficult to manufactor.

APPLE IIe

•	What year was it made? 
  1983
•	What operating system does it run? 
  DOS 3.3 
•	How much did it cost (then and now, adjusted for inflation)? How hard is it to find one on the secondhand market (check eBay and Craig’s List). 
  $1,295 then would cost $3,091.37 today. There are 91 listings on ebay for Apple iie computers many of which are for the modem and disk drives. The prices
  are pretty eratic but range around 199-299 for the modem, disk drives, and a couple of disks. Listings with a monitor tend ot be a lot more expensive and any
  listing with included disks is more expensive than those without. 
•	In brief (a short paragraph), what were its historical strengths and weaknesses as a platform? What was it best known for?
  According to Wikipedia and users on oldcomputers.com the Apple iie was considered the workhorse of the apple computers released around that time. 
  **************
Turn it on (you must figure out how). Work your way through the Apple Presents Apple tutorial. Try a game or two. (If you can beat one of my high scores on Sea Dragon you’ll get a prize. Really!)
  Besides the bulkiness of the monitor, disk drives, and modem, lack of a mouse, and the green text on a black screen which were also features of the Kaypro 4 another 
  difference I noted, which was also present in the Kaypro 4, was the reliance on keyboard shortcuts and prompts in lieu of a mouse to select menu options 
  and interact with the text. Also, a huge difference in operation was having to load discs everytime I wanted to change programs(as opposed to just opening a program from an app or clicking on an icon to access 
  a downloaded program stored on the computer's memory). One feature not included with my present laptop was the command to make a 'bing' noise when I push cntrl g which I feel 
  would be an excellent addition to my daily computer use. *******

MACINTOSH SE

•	What year was it made? 
  1987
•	What operating system does it run? 
  Classic MAC OS 3.3 and later versions
•	How much did it cost (then and now, adjusted for inflation)? How hard is it to find one on the secondhand market (check eBay and Craig’s List). 
  ******* There are 61 listings on ebay all of them mostly under $100. The main difference between cheaper offers and more expensive ones is the inclusion
  of accesories such as keyboards, mice, ethernet cords, and extra discs. 
•	In brief (a short paragraph), what were its historical strengths and weaknesses as a platform? What was it best known for?
  *************************
Turn it on (you must figure out how). Read some of Deena Larsen’s Marble Springs. Quit Marble Springs. What else is on this Mac?
  There are some other hypertexts saved on the computer in storyspace. There are also other accesories included, calculator, calender, ect..., that a user might 
  expect to find when looking in the 'systems' folder on a more modern computer. Since it is a Mac it already runs pretty differently from my Windows laptop including 
  the mouse without a right click option. It also, unlike my computer, has the ability to run storyspace and access hypertext files made in that program. The biggest difference 
  I noticed was the black and white screen as well as the way images and screens were loaded within the hypertext(from the top down).

VECTREX

•	What year was it made? 
  1982
•	What operating system does it run? 
  ****
•	How much did it cost (then and now, adjusted for inflation)? How hard is it to find one on the secondhand market (check eBay and Craig’s List). 
  When it first was put on market it was listed as $199 which would be $490.68 today. While there are 250 listings under "Vectrex" on ebay most of the listings are for games with a few 
  machines. The machines range from about $100-500 usually (games, controllers, original packaging being the major factors for more expensive listings). The games
  when listed separately range from around $20-$300 usually depending on the rarity, although, there was a listing for Mr. Boston's Clean Sweep starting at 4,999.99.  
•	In brief (a short paragraph), what were its historical strengths and weaknesses as a platform? What was it best known for?

Turn it on (you must figure out how). Play MineStorm. Try another cartridge. Why do you think the designer’s would have opted for the “vector” graphics?

AMIGA

•	What year was it made? 
  1985
•	What operating system does it run? 
  AmigaOS
•	How much did it cost (then and now, adjusted for inflation)? How hard is it to find one on the secondhand market (check eBay and Craig’s List). 
  It would have been $1595 (including monitor price) then which becomes $3,527.16 today with inflation. The most popular listings on ebay are for Amiga motherboards, RAM, and other internal 
  parts and not the computer itself. However, there are some listings for the Amiga which all seem to be around $200-400. There is also an 
  autction sight-http://amiga.classic-computer-auctions.com/-specifically for the computers that has listings (although these often double with ebay). 
•	In brief (a short paragraph), what were its historical strengths and weaknesses as a platform? What was it best known for?

Turn it on (you must figure out how). Try the demos. What else can it do? (Hint: try the “Amiga Appetizer” disk). Have a look at the Amiga magazines and the book, The Future Was Here.
  The first thing I noticed about the Amiga was that like the Kaypro 4 and Apple iie it needed to booted from discs and relied on discs in order to run most programs. I'm nto sure 
  if it was supposed to work that way usually, but it had me load the kickstart disc each time I tried to put another disc in before it would run the new program. I enjoyed messing aroudn in the piant and 
  music programs. I noticed that the computer kept track of the amount of memory being taken up so the user would know when they would run into trouble multi-tasking, 
  especailly since the computer allowed you to run programs in back of others and have multiple windows up at once (which the previous computers did not).

MACINTOSH IIci

•	What year was it made? 
  1989
•	What operating system does it run? 
  ****
•	How much did it cost (then and now, adjusted for inflation)? How hard is it to find one on the secondhand market (check eBay and Craig’s List). 
  Then, it would have cost $6,269 while now, adjusted for inflation it would be $12,029.65. There are only a few listings on ebay for the Macintosh iici, 30 in total, but only 
  11 are computers and not just parts or other parephenalia. The listings range from around $40-500 although most listings are below $200. 
•	In brief (a short paragraph), what were its historical strengths and weaknesses as a platform? What was it best known for?

Turn it on (you must figure out how). Open WordPerfect. Open MS Word. Try typing a simple document in each. Which do you like better, and why? Open MacPaint. Try drawing something. (You don’t need to save any of your work from these applications.) What else is on this Mac? What can you learn about its past user(s)?
